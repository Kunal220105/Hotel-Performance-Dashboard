# Hotel-Performance-Dashboard
Hotel Chain Performance Dashboard | Power BI Project
Developed a fully interactive hotel performance dashboard in Power BI using a simulated dataset of 5,000+ bookings across 7 properties.

Tracked key metrics including Revenue, Occupancy Rate (52.6%), ADR (₹14.7K), RevPAR (₹7.75K), and Guest Ratings (avg. 4.26).

Implemented drill-through functionality for hotel-level analysis (e.g., ITC Maratha), enabling deep-dives into room type revenue and booking trends.

Analyzed channel-wise performance (Walk-in, OTA, Corporate, etc.) and visualized cancellation rates, revenue contribution, and guest feedback.

Designed dynamic slicers for region, room type, feedback tags, and month to enhance report interactivity and user control.
